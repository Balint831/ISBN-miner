This repository cointains a small project. We have a ton of books at home and I wanted to make an inventory of them. 

Firstly, I scanned every ISBN code of the books. Then export the codes to a spreadsheet.

Secondly, from that spreadsheet with the use of http://www.mokka.hu/ (Hungarian Book Catalogue), 
I wanted to mine all the data of the books, namely the author, the title, the year of release, press office etc.
